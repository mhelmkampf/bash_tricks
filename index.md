### Keyboard shortcuts

```bash
tab        # auto-complete file / directory names
up arrow   # previous command
Ctrl + c   # interrupt / kill process
Ctrl + d   # close shell (== exit)

Ctrl + a   # go to beginning of line
Ctrl + e   # go to end of line
Ctrl + l   # clear screen (== clear)
```

### Quality-of-life commands

```bash
clear      # clear screen
history    # display command history (combine e.g. with grep: history | grep 'cd')
!<n>       # reissue command using history number
           
cd ~       # return to home directory (== cd $HOME)
cd /       # return to root directory
cd -       # return to last working directory
```

### Aliases

Aliases are shortcuts for long or often-used commands. They can be made permanent by adding them to `~/.bashrc`, a file containing commands that are executed automatically upon starting the shell.

```bash
alias <alias_name>="<command>"

# modify cd
alias ..="cd .."

# long format and color for ls
alias ll="ls -hl --color"

# view your jobs in the queue 
alias sq="squeue -u <user_id>"
```

### Wildcards

```bash
*         # matches any string of characters
?         # matches any one character
[abc]     # matches a, b, or c
```

### Variables

Variables are placeholders for information that can be retrieved or modified later. Typical values are strings (text, including file names and paths) and integers (numbers). The output (result) of another command can also be assigned, and wildcards are supported (see loops below).

```bash
VAR="example text"    # assign string (text) to variable
VAR=7                 # assign 7 to variable
VAR=$(command)        # assign command output, e.g. VAR=$(awk '{ print $1 }' file)

echo ${VAR}           # print current value of variable (== echo $VAR)
```
Examples for important pre-defined variables:
```bash
HOME   # path to home directory
PATH   # list of directories that will be searched for executables
PS1    # prompt layout
```

### Loops

Loops allow you to perform a set of commands multiple times, or repeat a set of commands with slight variations (e.g. multiple input files or lines). `for` and `while` loops are similar â€“ usually `for` loops are used when the number of iterations is known and/or small. `while` loops are better suited for an unknown and/or large number of iterations.

```bash
# General syntax: for each item in list, perform command(s)
for item in <list>
do
  <command1>
  <command2>
  ...
done

# Loops are usually indented, but can be written on one line using ";"
for item in <list> ; do <command1> ; <command2> ; ... ; done

# The list can be a series of strings or a range of numbers 
for i in A B C ; do echo ${i} ; done
for i in {1..3} ; do echo ${i} ; done

# If the list consists of lines in file, use a while loop
while read LINE ; do cat ${LINE}.fas ; done < list.txt

# If-else statement
if <condition> ; then
  <command1>
else
  <command2>
fi
```
